              <p><strong> Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907 - 23 March 1931) was a <b> Charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer. He was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist </b>. He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing <em> the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail</em>, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a <u> martyr and folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s</u> , and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence. </p><br>
